  <p>4th and 10 was founded by commissioner Anthony Marotta in 2019. After scouring his limited friends and contact list, he settled on 11 other managers to fill out this Dynasty Fantasy Football League. The inaugural season crowned Zeek Brown as its first champion, an occurrence that the other managers would soon come to despise…</p>
  <p>Rounding out the rest of the league was Chelsea, Kevin, Devin, JP, Jake, Casey, Shamus, Logan, Conor, and Charmaine. As the seasons pushed forward, 4th and 10 saw the departure of Charmaine (though not really, since she is chained in marriage to Casey), and the addition of Ryan. </p>
  <p>Through 6 grueling years, Zeek and Casey dominated the league, claiming 2.5 and 2 Chips respectively. A shimmer of hope occurred in 2023 when Shamus, the kid brother of Juggernaut Hays, slayed the beast. A collective exhale from the league’s managers was immediately silenced in the ’24 season when Hays, upon the back of known traitor Saquon Barkley, dominated the league yet again.</p>
  <p>As 4th and 10 continues onward, it remains a beacon of camaraderie and companionship, though managers may squabble frequently. With its members spanning the nation, this small dynasty league is a place to reminisce, plot and plan, trade, banter, vilify Zeek, and be amongst friends and family.</p>
